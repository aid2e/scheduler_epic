# Experiment Persistence

This documentation is currently under development.

Experiment persistence allows you to save the state of your optimization experiments and resume them later. This is especially useful for long-running experiments or when you need to pause and resume optimization.

## Features

- Save experiment state to disk
- Resume optimization from a saved state
- Track optimization history across sessions

Check back soon for the complete documentation.

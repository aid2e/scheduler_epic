# Please add the AID2E logo image here

To use the logo image, you need to:

1. Save the image you shared to this directory as `logo.png`
2. Create a smaller version for the favicon as `favicon.png` (ideally 32x32px or 64x64px)

You can do this by downloading the image you shared and copying it to this directory manually.

# Documentation Setup Summary

## Updates Made

1. **Updated GitHub Pages Setup Instructions**
   - Added information about using `requirements-docs.txt` for installing dependencies
   - Added instructions for creating the proper directory structure
   - Updated the step sequence and numbering
   - Added section about removing the left navigation sidebar
   - Made the instructions more general/reusable
   - Added instructions for manual deployment to GitHub Pages

2. **Created Documentation Generator Tools**
   - Created a script (`generate_docs.sh`) to automatically generate documentation structure
   - Included a sample `mkdocs.yml` configuration file
   - Added a README with usage instructions
   - Placed all tools in a separate `docs_create` directory as requested
   - Created a deployment script (`deploy_docs.sh`) for manual deployment
   - Added comprehensive GitHub Pages deployment guide

## How to Use the Documentation Generator

1. Navigate to the `docs_create` directory
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x generate_docs.sh`
3. Run the script: `./generate_docs.sh "Your Project Name" "username/repository"`
4. The script will generate a complete documentation structure with:
   - Basic Markdown files
   - Directory structure for tutorials and API reference
   - Custom GitBook-like CSS
   - GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
   
## Deployment Options

Two deployment options are now available:

### 1. Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions

The `generate_docs.sh` script creates a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and deploys your documentation whenever you push to the main branch. This is the recommended approach for most projects.

To use it:
- Push your documentation to GitHub
- Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings
- Set the source to "GitHub Actions"

### 2. Manual Deployment

For those who prefer to manually control the deployment process, the `deploy_docs.sh` script provides a streamlined way to build and deploy documentation to the `gh-pages` branch.

To use it:
```bash
./deploy_docs.sh "Your commit message"
```

Alternatively, you can follow the manual steps outlined in the GitHub Pages deployment guide.

## Removing the Left Sidebar

To remove the left navigation sidebar in your documentation:

1. Modify the `features` section in your `mkdocs.yml` file to remove navigation features
2. Add custom CSS to hide the sidebar completely

This has been documented in the updated GitHub Pages setup instructions.

## Next Steps

- Add your actual documentation content to the generated files
- Customize the theme and styling to match your project's branding
- Deploy to GitHub Pages following the instructions provided

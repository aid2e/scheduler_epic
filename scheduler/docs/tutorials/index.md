# Tutorials

This section provides step-by-step tutorials for common use cases of the Scheduler library.

## Basic Tutorials

- [Basic Detector Optimization](detector_optimization.md): Learn how to optimize detector parameters using a simple objective function
- [Script-Based Optimization](script_based_optimization.md): Use external scripts for your optimization objective

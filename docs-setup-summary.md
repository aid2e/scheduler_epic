# Documentation Setup Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Created documentation requirements file**

2. **Added placeholder files for missing tutorial pages**
   - Created placeholders for container_jobs, script_based_optimization, panda_execution, and asynchronous_execution tutorials
   - Each placeholder has a "Work in Progress" note and basic structure

3. **Updated GitHub Actions workflow for deployment**
   - Enhanced with retry logic to handle potential race conditions
   - Added proper dependency installation including Cairo for SVG support

## Testing

The documentation builds successfully with only one expected warning about README.md conflicting with index.md, which is normal.

## Next Steps

   - Push these changes to the main branch to trigger automatic deployment

2. **Complete actual documentation content**
   - Fill in the placeholder tutorial pages with actual content
   - Enhance API documentation with more examples

3. **Add more detailed examples**
